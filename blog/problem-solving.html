        <h4 class="txt-center txt-content-main-heading">That time I was blocked on a simple problem?</h4>
      </div>  
        <div class="txt-content txt-left">
          So I was working on the fizzbuzz problem. It was where you had to replace numbers that were divisible by either 15, 3, or 5. 
          With this problem I already knew I was going to try a 'if else' technique, because we had just gone through the conditionals module in the last sprint, and I really understood that stuff. Here is how I approached the problem:
          <ol>
            <li>I created my function and insert the key words that I knew I was going to use.</li>
            <li>Then I googled which symbols to use to divide numbers in Javascript</li>
            <li>When that didnt work I googled again to see what was missing and used terms like 'how to substitute a value with another value in an array..'</li>
            <li>All at the same time, I was looking at the error code to see what had changed in the messaging</li>
          </ol>
          <div>
            This fortunately was one of the ones where I could get to an answer pretty quickly. It felt really good to recognise and have a solid starting point and just know that I was needing to finesse how I was writing those conditions. <br>
            This was one of those moments that gave me a glimmer of hope that I could work things out on my own. It was a special moment where 'F*ck yeah' was fist pumped into the air.

        <h4 class="txt-center txt-content-main-heading">Did I ever elegantly solve a problem...?</h4>
      </div> 
        <div class="txt-content txt-left">
          There are so many examples of being blocked on a problem, but possible not many elegantly solved. <br>
          I think probably when I felt most awkwardly elegant was when I was doing a jam session with Sam. He kindly said he would help me work through a problem. 
          Even though I was barely holding onto the rails with my fingertips, it was good practice to step through the problem with him and what I was trying to do.
          I learnt that its so easy and important to ask the basic questions to build out my contextual understanding.  <br>
          I also learnt that Sam is super smart, and kind :) .

          <div>
            Using the traffic light system to idenitfy the level of confidence with each of these problem solving techniques:
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li class="green"><strong>Pseudocode:</strong></li>
              <div class="grey"> I learnt to do this a little later in the piece after seeing one of the facilitators brake down a problem. It was cool to see and the technique was a bit easier to follow.</div>
           
            <li class="green"><strong>Trying something:</strong></li>
              <div class="grey"> There was A LOT of trial and error going on. Sometimes blindly, often with an inkling of purpose.</div>
            
            <li class="orange"><strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong></li>
              <div class="grey">Didn't end up talking to the duck, but did talk things through out loud. 'So what I am trying to do is this....'</div>
            
            <li class="orange"><strong>Reading error messages:</strong></li>             
              <div class="grey">I didn't always get fully fledged out error messages, and sometimes trying to test code in Replit was a nightmare as well. But in some activities it was really straight forward what was missing or wrong in my code through reading these error messages.</div>
            
            <li class="orange"><strong>Console.logging:</strong></li>
              <div class="grey">Console.logging I wish I had done more of. I wasnt confident how to do it within this exercise/test scenario.</div>

            <li class="orange"><strong>Googling:</strong></li>
              <div class="grey">Googling was an interesting one. Sometimes I had wild success, sometimes it was a real drag to get anything useful, and in those instances I would be going down rabbit holes. </div>

            <li class="orange"><strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong></li>
              <div class="grey"> Sam the man! And Elisa who through a happy phone dropping accident managed to friend. </div>

            <li class="green"><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong></li>
              <div class="grey"> Isnt this funny. Logically I know that asking my coaches for help is the right thing to do, but I just feel really stupid asking. </div>

            <li class="orange"><strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong></li>
              <div class="grey"> What I did find good was taking breaks and thinking through problems away from the computer. It gave me new ideas of what to try. Sometimes very late at night (partner wasn't super pleased with that lol).</div>
