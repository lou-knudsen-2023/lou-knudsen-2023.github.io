How would you explain the dom?

My analogy for the Dom is that it is like a santaclaus in a show. 
behind the scenes it is parsing the current version of a website with all its moving parts. It also allows you to scan all elemnets across a website or tool and pull out, and manipulate information from all areas (or specific if thats what you want).



Window - like your browser, what going to pick up your document and understand it
Document - like a tab on your browser. This is where the DOM plays a role
Html, CSS, Javascript - individual written code documents that talk to each other. 


Node 
  'Elements'
    'HTML Elements'
          A list of each object representation of each elements 
          Its good that its an 'object representation' so that we can access it through using Javascript in the DOM. 
          We access all nodes (which are object representations) to easily manipulate (i.e. add remove or modify) elements of a website. 
          Common things we would manipulate would be tags, classes and IDs.
          Individual IDs are really useful in this case.
