            Emotional intelligence is to recognise, understand and balance both your own emotions and the emotions of others. 
            There are 5 components to emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-regulation, self-motivation, empathy and social skills. 
            If you have a high IQ you are able to identify your feelings,  know what those feelings mean, and how they may impact yourself or the people around you.

            IQ is the measurement of ability e.g. problem solving, critical thinking, logic, the ability to understand and/or communicate complex ideas. 
            EQ is all about emotion and being able to recognise that within yourself and others, AND be able to positively use that awareness to guide decisions.

          <h2><strong>Why is EQ important?</strong></h2>
          </div>
          <div>  
            We are all humans, and humans are social beings. 
            Because of this we need to know how to interact with others in a really effective way. 
            In a work context, this is the ability to sway and influence others, to 'read the room', to know how to best communicate or engage with individuals. 
            You could be the smartest person in the workplace, but you will still find it hard to move the needle without being able to work with others. 
          </div>
          <br></br> 
          <div>
            Having a high EQ also allows us to live better lives. We are less stressed, able to resolve conflicts more easily, have better realtionships, able to empathise and reactive positively off the back of that. 
            And just in general overcome challenges more easily.
