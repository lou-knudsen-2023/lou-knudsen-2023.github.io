                  <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
                </div>           
                  <div>
                  My short term plan is to get a job specifically where I can double down on my learning and really cement what I have learnt. 
                  Long term I feel like there could be something that brings in my skills as UX researcher into the software development world. I don't know what that is yet, but I have faith that there is something out there for me. 
                  For the most part, I'm trying to keep my mind on this course.  (I have a tendency to over think things!)

                  <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
                </div>
                  <div>    
                  I am organised, super organised. I'm good at juggling multuple things at once. 
                  I think visually. When someone explains something to me in code, I have to visualise it and then it makes sense. This slows me down a bit. 
                  I also think a limitation of mine is that I like to understand the big picture, and quite often will rabbit hole.

                  <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
                </div>    
                  <div>
                  I really want to learn how to think like a developer and know how to empathise with that world. What are the stressors that software developers encounter?
                  Empathy is a mental muscle, so always looking to stretch that.

                  </div>
                  <div>
                    I specifically will be looking to break things down into manageable chunks, and be very concious of what I need to persue and what I can put down and pick up when there is time. 
                    My first go to will be to talk with my team or facilitators when things get overwhelming. 
                    I also will lean on reminding myself 'this too shall come...'

                  </div>    
                    <div>
                      I may need to check in with facilitators more often to see if my balance between challenging and trying solutions myself, and seeking help is right. 
                      I have a feeling im going to be a bit slower in working through things, and want to strike that right balance.

                </div> 
                  <div> 
                    I expect the faciltation team to be available in a timely manner, and have multiple ways to help me uncover the answers. 
                  </div>

                <div>
                  <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
                </div> 
                  <div>  
                    I dont have an committments. I have cleared my schedule for that. 
                    The only thing I can think of is I typically walk Jake in the afternoons. My partner will be taking up all the dog walking during the week. But there could be the odd occassion where I will need to step in. I'm going to try and have this not be an issue. :)
