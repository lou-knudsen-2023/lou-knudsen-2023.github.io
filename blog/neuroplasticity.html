                  Neuroplasticity is the capacity for our brain cells to change in response to our behavior.
                  Not only can humans alter the way their brain works, but by focusing our attentions on brain development we can also physically alter the structure of the brain. 
                <br>
                  Studies have proven that imagination and action are integrated. So introducing both practices can greatly speed up and improve gaining new skills.

                  MENTAL PRACTICE HELPS TO INCREASE OUR CHANCE OF SUCCESS WHEN ABOUT TO CARRY OUT A TASKS.
                  Just by thinking about the task, or running through a scenario in your brain you are calling on that neurochemical pathway and the more we practice the more we strengthen those neurochemical pathways making it easier for us to recall or repeat tasks.

                  Neuroplasticity changes requires five components: 
                  <br></br>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Challenge and Novelty: being new and not easy to learn.</li>
                    <li>Intention: to have meaning, relevance or importance. </li>
                    <li>Specific attention: focusing on an exact tasks.</li>
                    <li>Reptition and Intensity: Short bouts of intense repetition</li>
                    <li>Time: patience, patience, patience! Change tikes time.</li>
                  </ol>

                Creating a plan for the skill you want learn will help you succeed. Here is my one for this course:
                  <ol>
                    <li>Choose a skill you want to learn: 
                      <br>Software development.</li>
                    <li>Why do you want to learn this skill: 
                      <br>Two reasons: I want this challenge. Software development always felt like it was out of my reach. I also have something missing in my career and think that somemthing as soothing as software development could be the answer.</li>
                    <li>Have a plan: 
                      <br>I have created my learning plan. I allocate time in my calendar specifically for this. I plan my breaks.</li>
                    <li>Check in:  
                      <br>First thing I do is create a plan for my day and what I am looking to achieve. At the end of the day I reflect on my day, update my goals and temperature check how I am going.</li>
                    <li>Plan for lapses: 
                      <br>Right now its important for me to have the blind faith that I will get there. It's so fortunate that this is the consistent messaging within this course. Maybe something engineered that way ;)</li>
                  </ol>

              </div>

            <div> 
              'Growth Mindset' the idea that we can grow our brain's capacity to learn and to solve problems. The opposite of a growth mindset is a 'Fixed mindset'. Which suggests that our capability is limited and immovable.

              <em>"THE POWER OF YET, NOT THE TYRANNY OF NOW." - psychologist Carol Dweck.
              </em>
                <br></br>
                  According to Carol, if we re-wire the way we think about effort and difficulty then a task being too hard could actually be turned into a task that is challenging me. One that I havent worked it out yet. 
                  This greatly impacts our motivation to push through and keep trying to work it out. 
                  This is imperative for software development as there is such a strong learning curve and often it is a brand new skill we are developing. 
                  Software Development is not easy and set backs are almost guaranteed. Having a growth mindset will help with fending of discouragment and enable us to bounce back quicker from disappointment.
            </div>
            <div>
              Having a growth mindset means:
               <ul>
                 <li>You believe that achievements are down to effort and not just inherent talent. </li>
                 <li>You are willing to learn from your mistakes and fine value in criticism. </li>
                 <li>You believe that your intelligenvec and ability can be developed.</li>
                 <li>You are willing to ask questions and admit when you dont know something. </li>
                 <li>You seek out challenging tasks and take on risks. </li>
               </ul>
