          <h2><strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</strong></h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <ol>
            <li>The power of the mind! <br>I have always known that I don't harness the power of my brain as effectively as I could.
                Knowing the science behind how the brain works when learning new skills has helped me attach meaning to the things I am doing. Instead of just staying 'practice makes perfect' I understand whats happening in my brain when I do practice or think throught problems - and that's a gamechanger!</li>
            <li>Self doubt is a killer<br>I have been crippled by self doubt before. It's so easy to get yourself into a downward spiral and embed those negative feelings.</li>
            <li>Strengthening pathways just through thought!<br> This one is cool! I was one of those sticklers who felt taking a break was wasting valuable time and often in those breaks I would be thinking about work. So it was a double edged sword, where I felt bad for taking a break and bad for not feeling like I had a break because I was still thinking about work.
                It was so pleasurable to take a break, close my eyes, and think through what I had just learnt, and KNOW that that was strengthening my recall and understanding.</li>
          </ol>  
        </div>
        <br></br> 

        <div>
        <h2><strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</strong></h2>
        </div>
        <div>  
          Well values gives you a home to always refer back to. It helps you to decide whats important or help guide decision making. 
          For empathy and self-awareness, this is all about how to work with others and understanding yourself. Its a broadening of perspectives and having the skills to be able to identify and address different situations. 
          People are weird and wonderful, and can be so different to us. Knowing how to recognise and adapt, for the best outcomes is essential to success both personally and professionally.
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2><strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong></h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          I wouldn't say I was suprised so much by the core learning, but I have enjoyed learning about the studies behind some of the core topics. 
          For example, the one were kids were encouraged in trying, rather than praised for succeeding. That is supremely interesting to me. 
        </div>
        <br></br> 

        <div>
        <h2><strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong></h2>
        </div>
        <div>  
          Honestly, the core topics are my stronger suit. I already had values in place before I started this course, and my career to date has been as a User Expereince researcher, so Empathy is a key requirement for success in that role. 
          So my biggest challenge was how to make the most out of the core modules. 
        </div>
        <br></br> 

        <div>
          <h2><strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
          </strong></h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          Like I mention in my <a href="emotional-intelligence.html">emotional intelligence blog</a> , EQ and IQ are the most effective ying and yang partnership. You could be the smartest person in the world, but in a working context if you struggle to work with others its all for naught. 
          On the flip side, you need to have some level of skillset or IQ in order to carry out your role. 
        </div>
        <br></br> 

        <div>
        <h2><strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer. -->
        </strong></h2>
        </div>
        <div>  
          Not a waste of time, but I'm wondering if there could be a slightly different path for those who are more confident in this space. There is always more to learn when it comes to core. <br>
          Maybe a conversation beforehand to identify what the core needs are of individuals.  I appreciate this could be more upfront work, but just a wee suggestion :) 
          I definitely enjoyed reading the supporting studies.
