            This website is for the Knudsen family to have one central place to:
            <ul>
              <li>Have one permanent, central place to share and find family resources.</li> 
              <li>Know when birthdays and family events are happening.</li>  
              <li>Share photos and messages to each other.</li>  
            </ul>
